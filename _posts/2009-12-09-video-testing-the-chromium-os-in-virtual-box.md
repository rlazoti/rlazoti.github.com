Like most people, I also wanted to know about the new operating system Google's Chromium OS, then in a quick search I found a link to download a virtual machine with Virtual Box Chromium OS.

An interesting point about the new OS is that logging in, you must have a Gmail account.

The link to download the VM is [ http://www.ausgamers.com/news/read/2816103](http://www.ausgamers.com/news/read/2816103)

I made a video showing how to use the VM in Virtual Box.

<div id="ytplayer"></div>

  var tag = document.createElement('script');
  tag.src = "https://www.youtube.com/player_api";
  var firstScriptTag = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
  firstScriptTag.parentNode.insertBefore(tag, firstScriptTag);

  var player;
  function onYouTubePlayerAPIReady() {
    player = new YT.Player('ytplayer', {
      height: '390',
      width: '640',
      videoId: 'g5my_CyRuKc'
    });
  }
