[htop](http://htop.sourceforge.net/) is a great interactive process viewer in text-mode, but unfortunately it works only on [Linux](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).
Fortunately I found in [Github](http://github.com) a htop version for [OSX](http://www.apple.com/br/macosx/) and it works perfectly.

To install it, before you'll need to haveÂ [git](http://git-scm.com/) (if you already don't have git installed :]).
So, below you can see how to install it.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
git clone git://github.com/AndyA/htop-osx.git
cd htop-osx
git checkout -b osx origin/osx
export CFLAGS="-m32"
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}


To run it, just execute **htop** in your terminal. ;)
