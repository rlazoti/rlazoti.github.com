Hello world! :D

After some time, finally I decided to write in English.
First because I need to improve my writing skill, second because writing in English I can reach a larger audience and thus share information with more people around the world and not only with people from Brazil.

Apart from the new posts, I want to translate some old posts written in Portuguese to English too.
If you want the translation of some post, let me know ok.

Please, let me know if you find any typo in my posts. :)
